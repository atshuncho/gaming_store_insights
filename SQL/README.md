## SQL Analysis
The analysis answers 8 key questions:

1. **How many users were exposed to each variant, and how many made a purchase?**  
2. **What percentage of sessions ended in a purchase in each variant?**  
3. **Does purchase rate vary by region between variants?**  
4. **Does purchase rate vary by user type (new vs returning)?**  
5. **Does purchase rate vary by device (mobile, PC, console)?**  
6. **Did the banner increase or decrease revenue (after discounts)?**  
7. **Are users with the banner returning more often (avg sessions per user, % with 2+ sessions)?**  
8. **Are users in Variant B adding to cart more often, and are they completing purchases?**

## Example Insights
Running the SQL produces insights like:

- **Overall Conversion** → Users in variant B were slightly more likely to make a purchase (around 2% more likely).  
- **User Segments** → New mobile users benefit strongly from the banner, but returning console/PC users are negatively affected (banner fatigue).  
- **Revenue** → Despite higher conversion, Variant B produces **lower total revenue** due to discounts.  
- **Retention** → Users exposed to the banner don’t necessarily return more often. They’re more likely to make a one-time discounted purchase.
